## Problem Statement

- Write a process to match all items in dataset A to items in dataset B.
- Calculate the matching accuracy.
- Merge the two datasets into a single CSV including all columns.

## Solution Overview

Outline the approach you took to solve the problem. Highlight the key algorithms, data structures, or techniques you employed.

## Assumptions and Constraints

Discuss any specific assumptions or constraints provided in the challenge and how they influenced your design.

## Implementation Details

Provide more technical details about your solution, including the programming language, frameworks, and libraries you used.

## Code Structure

Describe the organization of your codebase, including an overview of the main modules or classes and their responsibilities.

## Algorithm Complexity

Discuss the time and space complexity of your solution. Explain why your approach is efficient or how it could be optimized further.

## Testing

Detail the testing process you followed, including any test cases you used to verify the correctness of your solution.

## Performance Considerations

- If dataset_a was just as large as dataset_b:
  -
- Modularity of checking dataset columns:
  -

## Challenges Faced

Describe any challenges or difficulties you encountered during the implementation and how you overcame them.

## Future Improvements

- Clean up final_dataset:
  - Threshold for match accuracy: Keep rows above a certain match accuracy.
  - Drop '_x' and '_y' columns
